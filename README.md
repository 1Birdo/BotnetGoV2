### ðŸš€ What's New?
This isn't just an update; it's a total transformation. V2 delivers everything the original was missing and more:
- **Secure Login Portal**: No more basic auth. A full, secure login system.
- **Live Interaction**: See command results as they happen, not just static output.
- **GIF & UI Enhancements**: A visually engaging experience that doesn't sacrifice functionality.
- **...and much more**: Improved stability, cleaner codebase, and easier customization.

> **Warning:** Use responsibly and ethically. The developer is not responsible for misuse.
